Compilation
-----------

We use maven to handle our dependencies.

* Install [Maven 3](http://maven.apache.org/download.html)
* Check out and install [Bukkit](http://github.com/Bukkit/Bukkit)
    * *Note*: this is not needed as the repository we use has Bukkit too, but you might have a newer one (with your own changes :D)
* Check out this repo and: `mvn clean package`

You may use it as long as you follow the text above and below you. 

1. You credit me as the kind soul for forking a fork of CraftBukkit for your uses.
2. You tell Mojang to fix their fucking shitty EULA so they can't screw up any more of the Minecraft community from trying to do anything efficently (WorldEdit, NBT editor, Bungeecord, etc) by using any means nessary. (Facebook, Tweet, Tumblr, Google+, Blog, email, GitHub, snail mail, Linkedin and myspace about it to them, punch lawyers in the face, ask intellegent questions to them about it @ Minecon 2014/2015, tell Notch to STFU about Minecraft ELUA if he does not run it, etc)
3. Tell Mojang to undo the TNT being moved by the water thing, it's unessary and ruins TNT cannons.
4. Ask Mojang to fix their bug tracker, if it's more than 50% duplicates, you think they would fix it but they only will if one person whines about it which brings me to...
5. Tell Mojang to get rid of the whole "Only fix things if people complain about it and does not involve the EULA or anything else retarded we did" mentality, It will cost Mojang too many problems later on when it's found out that people prefer the "bugs".
6. Ask Mojang to listen to the PvP community for once. Mojang doesn't care about PvP.
7. Tell Mojang they learned an important life lesson, that they should tell everyone what the fuck is going on when they suddenly buy/take owner-ship of a company or organization.
