You see, I believe that open source stuff that is copyrighted is a stupid idea, and that maybe people should think twice about how their code would be forked and borrowed and copied and pasted and fixed and improved on before hitting that commit button.  So here are downloads right here, step right up!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
